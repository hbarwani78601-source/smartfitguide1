        <h1 class="mb-1">How Much Weight Should Beginners Start With?</h1>
        <p class="text-muted">By SmartFitGuide Team</p>

        <div class="mt-2 article-content">
            <p>One of the most common questions we get is, "What size dumbbells should I buy?" The answer isn't
                one-size-fits-all, but there are simple guidelines to help you choose safely.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-2">Why Starting Light Matters</h2>
            <p>Your tendons and ligaments adapt slower than your muscles. Starting too heavy is the fastest way to get
                injured (tendonitis, strains) or develop bad form. It is always better to master the movement with light
                weight first.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-2">General Beginner Ranges</h2>
            <p>While everyone is different, here are typical starting points for most beginners:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Upper Body (Presses, Rows):</strong> 10lbs - 20lbs (4kg - 9kg)</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Body (Squats, Lunges):</strong> 20lbs - 40lbs (9kg - 18kg)</li>
                <li><strong>Isolation (Bicep Curls, Lateral Raises):</strong> 5lbs - 12lbs (2kg - 5kg)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Note: This is general guidance, not medical advice. Listen to your body.</em></p>

            <h2 class="mt-2">The "Last 2 Reps" Rule</h2>
            <p>How do you know if a weight is right? Aim for 10-12 repetitions. The last 2 reps should feel challenging
                but doable with perfect form.
                <br>• If you can't finish 8, it's too heavy.
                <br>• If you can do 15 easily, it's too light.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-2">Why Adjustable Dumbbells Win</h2>
            <p>As a beginner, you will get stronger <em>fast</em>. Buying a single pair of 15lb dumbbells is a mistake
                because you will outgrow them in weeks for squats, but they might be too heavy for lateral raises.</p>
            <p>Adjustable dumbbells grow with you, saving you money and space in the long run.</p>
