        <div class="mt-2 article-content">
            <p>Creatine Monohydrate is the most researched sports supplement in history. Yet, it is also the most
                misunderstood. Let's clear up the confusion.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-2">What Does It Do?</h2>
            <p>Your muscles use energy called ATP. When you lift heavy weights, ATP runs out quickly (in seconds).
                Creatine helps your body replenish ATP slightly faster.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> You might be able to do 1-2 extra reps or lift slightly heavier weight. Over
                months, this adds up to more muscle growth.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-2">Common Myths</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> It causes hair loss. <br><strong>Truth:</strong> The evidence for this is
                    extremely weak and mostly anecdotal.</li>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> It's a steroid. <br><strong>Truth:</strong> Absolutely not. It is a natural
                    compound found in red meat.</li>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> You need to "cycle" it. <br><strong>Truth:</strong> No, you can take 3-5g
                    daily consistently.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="mt-2">Who Should Avoid It?</h2>
            <p>If you have pre-existing kidney issues, always talk to a doctor first. Also, teenagers should generally
                focus on food and training before supplements.</p>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Drink plenty of water when taking creatine, as it pulls water into your
                    muscle cells.</p>
